# Claude Code Session Preparation for Harmonia Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the preparation for the Claude Code session to implement Harmonia, the workflow orchestration component for Tekton. The files created provide a comprehensive implementation plan, deliverables checklist, project structure, and task prompt for Claude.

## Files Created

1. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**
   - Comprehensive implementation guide for Harmonia
   - Includes requirements, API structure, data models, UI components
   - Outlines integration with other Tekton components
   - Provides testing strategy and documentation requirements

2. **DELIVERABLES.md**
   - Detailed checklist of all expected deliverables
   - Organized by component (API, engine, state management, etc.)
   - Includes code, documentation, test, and project management deliverables
   - Tracks Hermes registration and component integration

3. **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**
   - Recommended project structure for implementation
   - Detailed file organization with descriptions
   - Implementation sequence recommendation
   - Key files to focus on initially
   - Shared utilities to leverage

4. **CLAUDE_TASK_PROMPT.md**
   - Task description for Claude Code session
   - Step-by-step guide for understanding requirements
   - Implementation focus areas
   - Technical requirements
   - Implementation notes and priorities

## Implementation Focus

The implementation focuses on eight key areas:

1. **API Implementation**: FastAPI with Single Port Architecture
2. **Core Engine**: Workflow execution with complex patterns
3. **State Management**: Persistence with checkpoint and resume
4. **Template System**: Reusable workflow templates
5. **Error Handling**: Retry policies and recovery
6. **External Integration**: Webhooks and events
7. **LLM Integration**: Workflow optimization with tekton-llm-client
8. **UI Component**: Workflow designer in Hephaestus

## Using Existing Code

The implementation will build upon:

- `client.py`: Client implementation with component client
- `core/engine.py`: Workflow execution engine scaffold
- `core/workflow.py`: Workflow and task data models
- `core/state.py`: State management foundations

## Leveraging Shared Utilities

The implementation will use all ten shared utilities:
- HTTP client for component communication
- Configuration management for settings
- Logging for structured logs
- WebSocket management for real-time updates
- Hermes registration for component discovery
- Error handling for standardized errors
- Component lifecycle for proper management
- Authentication for API security
- Context management for request tracking
- CLI for command-line interface

## Potential Shared Utilities

During implementation, look for patterns that could become shared utilities:
- Workflow engine abstractions
- Task dependency resolution
- Template system
- Visualization tools
- State management patterns

## Claude Code Session Execution

When executing the Claude Code session:

1. Start by asking Claude to review the IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md, DELIVERABLES.md, and PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
2. Have Claude examine the existing code to understand current implementation
3. Follow the implementation sequence in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
4. Focus first on core models, engine, and API implementation
5. Implement and test components incrementally
6. Ensure all deliverables are completed
7. Verify integration with other Tekton components
8. Update the Tekton roadmap upon completion

## Final Verification

Before completing the sprint, ensure:
- All items in DELIVERABLES.md are checked
- All API endpoints are implemented and tested
- UI component is functional in Hephaestus
- Documentation is comprehensive
- Tests have good coverage
- Integration with other components is working
- Roadmap is updated to reflect completion
